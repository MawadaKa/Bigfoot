# Bigfoot
This project was created to answer the question: is Bigfoot real? annd how can you meet one?
To answer the question I used the database from BFRO (https://data.world/timothyrenner/bfro-sightings-data), which contained the data from each sightseeing of the Bigfoot in the United States.
I cleaned the data, processed it, and analysed where was Bigfoot seen the most and in which conditions. to know more about the result, check the file: How to meet a Bigfoot.pdf
